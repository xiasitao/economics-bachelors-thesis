# Intro
- accessible vs inaccessible role models influence on identity
- mostly selecting relatable, successful role models
    - accessible: overcoming difficulties, building success
    - inaccessible: shaping future
    - justification for relatability label
- educational intervention with distant role models
- intervention on socially disadvantaged

# Conclusion
- relatability:
    - interest, background, experience
    - accessible: socioemotional support, comforting, less goal-driven
    - inaccessible: extreme examples of success
- identification with distant communities that are inaccessible in the local context, more options in development/pursuit of life

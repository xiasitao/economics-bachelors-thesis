## Cleaning
- Unify sentence boundaries ('.')


## Filtering
- Filter out stubs (e.g. under three sentences) and epics (e.g. more than 200 sentences)
- Filter out articles with wrong content (e.g. cookie banner)

## SES
- SES data is very imbalanced
    - maybe select equal amounts of positive and negative SES samples with the role models with most articles

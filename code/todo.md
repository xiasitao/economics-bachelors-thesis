# Descriptives
- Sanity checks!

# SES
- Compare professions of role models between SES groups

# Topic model
- fix hypertopics
- alternative: only fit low and high SES articles and compare topics, plot topic distributions

# Zero Shot
- run success

# Semantic clustering
- combine with topic model
    - find topics in the clusters
    - find SES-score percentages in the clusters
    - perform chi2 tests by cluster for SES to see if SES varies based on semantic similarity

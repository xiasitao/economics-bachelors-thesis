## Data
- more mentions per role model
    - take score/"negativity" or "positivity"/number of mentions into account
- survey
    - preset role models (threat: non-freely selected role model, adv: more control of scopes/research scopes chosen directly, more control over topics, more role model variation)
    - 

# NLP and Inference
- more sophisticated aggregation
    - away from article-level
    - away from text-related measures towards NLP as just a tool
    - role model labeling base on articles

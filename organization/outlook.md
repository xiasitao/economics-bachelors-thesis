# Discussion
## Validity
- Methods
    - aggregation is straightforward but probably not elaborate enough
    - needs more case-by-case analysis, e.g. drugs
    - more accuracy checks
- Data
    - high role model variation
    - low variation of SES pre role model
    - low role model profession/background variation
    - newspaper articles (incomplete, website bias, internet bias?)
- Research question
    - causality? SES influences role models, but not other way around
    - difference alone interesting, finding reasons, circumstances
    - what is beyond newspaper articles, e.g. social media, peer effects

# Outlook
## Data
- more mentions per role model
    - take score/"negativity" or "positivity"/number of mentions into account
- survey
    - preset role models (threat: non-freely selected role model, adv: more control of scopes/research scopes chosen directly, more control over topics, more role model variation)
    - 

# NLP and Inference
- more sophisticated aggregation
    - away from article-level
    - away from text-related measures towards NLP as just a tool
    - role model labeling base on articles

# Context
- Interviewing participants again after longer time
    - evolution of role models
    - evolution of NLP results
- Suggestions and Interventions
    - Role models as indicators for future preferences, e.g. on labor market
    - Steering role model self-selection through fostering certain topics, contexts, connotations, journalistic styles during educations/adolescence

\chapter{Natural Language Processing Algorithms}
In this chapter, the natural language algorithms and language models that were used in the unsupervised and the supervised analysis approaches are introduced. All of them aim to group the celebrity newspaper articles based on their content or properties of their content. While topic modelling and semantic similarity clustering represent unsupervised clustering models, zero-shot classification can be counted towards the supervised classification algorithms.

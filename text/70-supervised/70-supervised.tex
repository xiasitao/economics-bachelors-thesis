\chapter{Supervised Analysis: Zero-Shot Classification}\label{ch:supervised}
In this chapter, the exploration of differences between the low- and high-\gls{ses} groups is continued by focusing on other aspects of the celebrity newspaper articles apart from topics. A BART-based zero-shot classification scheme is presented for examining the articles with respect to sentiment and emotion, connotations of success, prosociality, crime, and journalistic styles. After assessing the classification accuracy and confirming that the findings agree with the topic modelling procedure, interpretable differences between the \gls{ses} groups in terms of sentiment, success and prosociality are discussed along with potential improvements of the modelling approach.

\section{Analysis Procedure}
In contrast to topic modelling, in the case of zero-shot classification (see section~\ref{ch:zero_shot}), training and optimization have already been performed by the model provider. The employed BART model is not trained on any inputs and is not altered during the classification process in this thesis. It can assign a relative semantic proximity $p_{i, l}$ between a given newspaper article $i$ and a label $l$ out of a set of labels. This quasi-probability represents how close the meaning of the label is to the meaning of the article. Similar to the procedure in topic modelling, a label was assigned to an article if it had the highest proximity:
\begin{align}
    l_{i} = \arg \max_{l'} p_{i, l'}
\end{align}
Like in the topic modelling procedure, the information-theoretical entropy \autocite{gray_entropy_2013} for each article was calculated as a measure of how confident the model was in predicting the label:
\begin{align}
    H_i = -\sum_{l'} p_{i, l'} \ln p_{i, l'}.
\end{align}
Low entropy signifies that the model could attest a very close proximity to one of the labels, hence the assignment is unambiguous, whereas a high value of $H_i$ testifies an ambiguous association between the article and the label. As the range of $H$ depends on the number $n_\text{labels}$ of labels, the following normalized variant is used for comparing the model confidence for different sets of labels:
\begin{align}
    \widetilde{H}_i = \frac{H_i}{\ln n_\text{labels}}
\end{align}

Note that in contrast to the previous chapter's concept of hypertopics, which are labels manually assigned based on the topics' characterizing word lists, here the model quantifies the semantic relationship between each article and a given label.

In order to examine the article texts with respect to the various aspects of role model influence motivated in chapter~\ref{ch:this_thesis}, namely topic, sentiment, prosociality, success, delinquency, and journalistic style, for each of these aspects one or more \textit{categories} and corresponding sets of labels were compiled. The labels of each category were chosen based on the author's intuition and on what appeared interesting for the analysis of role model qualities with regard to the mentioned aspects.

BART then assigns a relative proximity $p$ to each label for this article. This is repeated for different categories, each having a different set of labels. The BART model itself does not depend on any input and is not altered during the process.}\label{fig:zero_shot_schema}
\end{figure}

The classification procedure is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:zero_shot_schema}. The technical integration of the BART model was conducted as suggested in \textcite{huggingfacebart-large-mnli_facebookbart-large-mnli_nodate}. As an input to the model, the text in the \textit{content} stage was used, i.e. with most structure of the human language preserved.

\section{Accuracy}\label{ch:supervised_accuracy}
In a first evaluation step, the accuracy of the zero-shot classification was assessed using the human annotated data. To this end, the model made a prediction for each article from the set of labels used in the human annotation process, namely \textit{life}, \textit{movie}, \textit{music}, and \textit{sports}. An accuracy (cf. equation~\ref{eq:accuracy}) of \SI{58}{\percent} was achieved, human annotation and the model-predicted topic labels are compared in the confusion matrix in figure~\ref{fig:zero_shot_confusion_matrix_topic}, showing that the model's main error is counting articles that the human annotator marked as sport-related to the label \textit{life}. It was conjectured that this might stem from an alledged semantic proximity of the word ``life'' with ``live sports''. Therefore an alternative set of labels with the \textit{life} label exchanged for \textit{social} was checked. For it an almost equal accuracy of \SI{56}{\percent} was achieved, the confusion matrix is shown in figure~\ref{fig:zero_shot_confusion_matrix_topic_l}. Indeed, this reduced the confusion with the label \textit{sport}, but instead a more pronounced confusion of \textit{social} and \textit{movie} showed up, which is also not surprising considering that reports about movie plots often convey social aspects. Looking at the averaged normalized entropies showed that the model makes more convinced predictions if \textit{life} is replaced by \textit{social}, $\Braket{\widetilde{H}}_\text{life} = 0.87 > 0.77 = \Braket{\widetilde{H}}_\text{social}$.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Confusion matrices comparing the model prediction and the human annotation for the \textit{topic} and \textit{topic (soc.)} categories. Accuracies of \SI{58}{\percent} and \SI{56}{\percent} respectively were achieved in predicting the human annotation labels. The most pronounced mistake for the \textit{topic} category is that the model labels many articles as \textit{life} which the human annotator had labelled as \textit{sport}. For the \textit{topic (soc.)} category, this is slightly reduced at the cost of a confusion of the human-annotated label \textit{movie} with the predicted label \textit{social}.}\label{fig:zero_shot_confusion_matrices}
\end{figure}

The accuracy of the zero-shot approach is hence less than in the topic modelling approach with a pre-trained model (\SI{76}{\percent}). However, the qualitative accuracy recognizable from the confusion matrices can be considered remarkable given that the has not been trained on the corpus of newspaper articles. Since the articles' true topics cannot unambiguously be classified and thus also the human-annotated labels are subject to uncertainty, the zero-shot approach is arguably still very promising despite its lower accuracy, especially given that it makes it possible to explore all the non-topic aspects of newspaper articles examined in the following.


\section{Results}\label{ch:supervised_results}
In total, the model assigned labels from twelve categories to each article. As was done in the evaluation of topic modelling, the distribution of the articles across the labels of each category was then compared for the low-\gls{ses} and the high-\gls{ses} groups.

Again, a $\chi^2$ contingency test was used to identify significant differences between the label distributions (cf. equation~\ref{eq:h0_contingency}):
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        H_{0, \text{contingency}}: ~~~ &\text{distributions } p_{s, l} \text{ over labels } l \text{ are indepedent of } s\\
    & \text{i.e. } p_{s, l} = p_s \cdot p_l ~~ \forall l, s
    \end{split}
\end{align}
A set of per-label $\chi^2$ tests were conducted to find significant differences in the amount of articles per label (cf. equation~\ref{eq:h0_topic}):
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        H_{0, \text{ label }l}: ~~~ &\text{number of articles } n_{s, l} \text{ equals expected number } \tilde n_{s, l} \\
        & \text{i.e. } n_{\text{low}, l} = \tilde n_{\text{low}, l} \text{ and } n_{\text{high}, l} = \tilde n_{\text{high}, l},
    \end{split}
\end{align}
with the number of articles $n_s$ in \gls{ses} group $s$, the number of articles $n_l$ associated with label $l$, the total number $n$ of articles, and the expected number of articles $\tilde n_{s, l} = n_s \cdot \frac{n_l}{n}$ per label $l$ and \gls{ses} $s$ assuming independence from \gls{ses}. \footnote{Note that for high $n_l$, a certain deviation of $n_{s, t}$ from the expectation $\tilde n_{s, t}$ is \textit{less significant} than for a low $n_l$, as the deviation relative to $n_l$ is smaller for high $n_l$. Especially for two-label categories, this can lead to potentially unintuitive outcome that the prevailing label (high $n_l$) in a distribution has less significance in the per-label test than the less frequent label (low $n_l$). This can be seen in the results in table~\ref{tab:zero_shot_result_table}, e.g. for the category \textit{prosociality}.}

All examined categories and their respective labels, the respective distributions of articles across the labels, and the results of the $\chi^2$ tests are listed in table~\ref{tab:zero_shot_result_table}. The following paragraphs present these categories and their labels, and analyze the found distributions.

\end{table}

\paragraph{Topics}
The topic aspect of the newspaper articles was covered by the \textit{topic} and \textit{topic (soc.)} categories, as already mentioned in the previous section. Both show similar differences in the distribution of low- and high-\gls{ses} articles, for \textit{topic (soc.)} it is shown in figure~\ref{fig:zero_shot_distribution_topic_l}. In accordance with the findings in topic modelling, the topics of \textit{music} and \textit{sports} have higher prevalence among the low-\gls{ses} than the high-\gls{ses} group, and in turn the \textit{movie} topic is more common in the high-\gls{ses} than the low-\gls{ses} group. In contrast to topic modelling, here the \textit{life} or \textit{social} label also exposes a significant difference between the \gls{ses} groups, namely being more favored by the high-\gls{ses} group. All these observations are more pronounced in the \textit{distinct-\gls{ses}} dataset.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Sentiment and Emotion}
Article sentiment was examined in two categories: In \textit{sentiment} only \textit{positive} and \textit{negative} sentiment labels were differentiated, for \textit{sentiment (n)}, a \textit{neutral} label was added. For the \textit{mixed-\gls{ses}} dataset, in none of the categories significant differences appear. For the \textit{distinct-\gls{ses}} data, a tendency towards higher prevalence of negative sentiment in the low- and higher prevalence of neutral and positive sentiment in the high-\gls{ses} groups can be discerned, but with significance not below the \SI{1}{\percent} level (see figure~\ref{fig:zero_shot_distribution_sentiment_distinct}). These findings match with what \textcite{fenske_using_2022} found on very similar data using different \gls{nlp} approaches.

    \caption{\textit{Sentiment} and \textit{sentiment with neutrality} label distributions in the \textit{distinct-\gls{ses}} dataset: A tendency of the low-\gls{ses} group towards negative sentiment and of the high-\gls{ses} group to neutral and positive sentiment is apparent.}\label{fig:zero_shot_distribution_sentiment_distinct}
\end{figure}

Emotion was captured with the six labels \textit{anger}, \textit{disgust}, \textit{fear}, \textit{happiness}, \textit{sadness}, and \textit{surprise} as suggested as the six basic emotions by \textcite{uwa_our_2019}. Except for a slightly significant dominance of \textit{sadness} in the low-\gls{ses} group in the \textit{distinct-\gls{ses}} dataset, no \gls{ses} differences in conveyed emotion can be attested.

\paragraph{Success}
The category of \textit{success}, represented by the labels \textit{success} and \textit{failure}, is particularly interesting assuming that perception of success in one's role models could correlate with inspiration for one's own success-seeking behavior and hence entail implications for social mobility. The model outputs show a tendency of a higher prevalence of success-conveying articles among the high-\gls{ses} group, this is however by no means significant. The mean entropy values for the \textit{success} label are relatively low, meaning that the model was comparably confident in attesting the notion of success, making this category promising to take closer looks at.

\paragraph{Relatability}
Although relatability is an important aspect in the role model literature, as has been elaborated in section~\ref{ch:role_models}, the model output does not point to any significant differences between the labels \textit{distant} and \textit{relatable} across both \gls{ses} groups.

\paragraph{Delinquency and Prosociality}
Another two well-discussed aspects in the literature are those of delinquency and prosociality (see section~\ref{ch:role_models}). Prosociality was encoded in the labels \textit{antisocial} and \textit{prosocial}. For the \textit{distinct-\gls{ses}} dataset, a significant dominance of an \textit{antisocial} connotation among the low-\gls{ses} group compared to the high-\gls{ses} group can be attested.

        \caption{\textit{prosociality} (\textit{distinct-\gls{ses}})}

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{\textit{Prosociality} and \textit{crime type} label distributions in the \textit{distinct-\gls{ses}} dataset: A correlation of \textit{antisocial} connotation with low \gls{ses} and of \textit{prosocial} connotation with high \gls{ses} is evident. A comparative prevalence of \textit{drug}-labelled articles in the low-\gls{ses} group is visible.}
\end{figure}

In terms of delinquency, the model couldn't establish any significant differences between the \gls{ses} groups in the \textit{crime} category which differentiates between \textit{criminal} and \textit{innocent} connotation. In the category \textit{crime type}, however, a significant difference shows for the label \textit{drugs}, suggesting that drug-related articles are more common in the low-\gls{ses} group. For the other crime types of \textit{sexual assault} and \textit{violence} as well as the label \textit{innocent}, no significant differences were found. Comparing the two delinquency categories, one should note that the share of \textit{innocent}-labelled articles is a lot higher when not differentiating by crime type. Along with a comparably high average normalized entropy, this suggests that the model is not delivering reliable and unambiguous predictions with respect to criminal connotation.

\paragraph{Newspaper Coverage}
Finally, journalistic properties of the newspaper articles were examined with the categories \textit{article type} and \textit{writing style}, potentially exposing any differences in celebrity news consumption across the \gls{ses} groups as hinted at in section~\ref{ch:ses}. No significant differences were found between the four labels of \textit{writing style} (\textit{embellished}, \textit{expository}, \textit{narrative}, and \textit{persuasive}, as suggested by \cite{traffis_learn_2017}). In contrast, for the category \textit{article type}, made up by the labels \textit{entertainment}, \textit{news}, \textit{opinion}, and \textit{report} (as suggested by \cite{davis_4_2022}), articles labelled as \textit{entertainment} and \textit{news} are more common in the high-\gls{ses} than the low-\gls{ses} group, while it is opposite for \textit{opinion} and \textit{reports}. Even though the differences here are for the most part significant, it must be noted that the high average normalized entropy suggests that the model was generally not sure about the label assignment. The article types' distributions are probably correlating with the article topics, meaning that e.g. the high-\gls{ses} group's preference for movie-related articles could be reflected in their seeming inclination towards \textit{entertainment} articles.

\section{Discussion}
In this chapter, zero-shot classification based on the BART model was explored for labelling the celebrity newspaper articles with respect to topics, sentiment, relatability, delinquency and prosociality, as well as journalistic aspects. Differences in the distributions of these labels between articles about low-\gls{ses} and high-\gls{ses} role models were examined.

The higher prevalences of sports- and music-related articles in the low-\gls{ses} and of movie-related topics in the high-\gls{ses} group matches with the findings in the topic modelling approach in chapter~\ref{ch:unsupervised}. The achieved accuracy is, however, smaller. A tendency of low-\gls{ses} articles towards negative sentiment and of high-\gls{ses} articles towards neutral positive sentiment could be seen, even though it was not highly significant. Similarly, when differentiating between articles with the notion of success and failure, a tendency towards association of failure-related articles with the low-\gls{ses} and of success-related articles with the high-\gls{ses} group is discernible, but not significant. A remarkable finding in the area of delinquency and prosociality is that the well-researched link between prosociality, role models, and \gls{ses} is appearing in the data, with articles with antisocial connotation being more common in the low-\gls{ses}  than in the high-\gls{ses} group. Drug-related articles were found to be significantly more frequent in the low-\gls{ses} group. No significant and independently interpretable differences between the \gls{ses} groups were found in the categories of emotion, relatability, and in journalistic style. The \gls{ses} differences in the latter are believed to be mostly attributable to the \gls{ses} groups' topic preferences.

The internal validity of the classification procedure was assessed for article topics. Despite the rather mediocre accuracy compared to the topic modelling approach, the model's prediction seemed convincing from a qualitative standpoint. The validity for all other categories was, however, not checked, and it is uncertain whether the level of accuracy achieved for the topics can be extrapolated to all other examined categories. In an improved version of this procedure, these categories should also be quality-assessed, e.g. by human-annotating a subset of the articles with the respective labels. As the modelling procedure compares the articles' and the labels' semantics, such crosschecks will be especially important for categories with rather abstract labels, e.g. emotion, since the meaning of the labels is usually not literally present in the articles.
